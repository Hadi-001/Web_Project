Team: Adeeb Boumoghlbey, Hadi Shayya, Karam Alsaify

This project is supposed to be made out of about 15 html pages. The functionality of this website is assisting people to regulate and healthily deal with their mental health.


All content and material of the website (not the code but the informaion) is generated by chatgpt.



header > nav-bar: 

    This component is found in almost every page(not found in login, signup, or tests pages) and in all of them it looks and functions the same.

    This component is from bootstrap but adjustments in the html and css were made to change the color to light blue, and to prevent the elements from overflowing (at the screen size where elements overflow and the menu is not in mobile drop-down style yet, the margin of the links inside the nav-bar is changed from 15px to 7px)



footer: 
    This component is found in almost all pages (not found in login, signup, or tests pages) and contains basic information and links to the FAQ page and the privacy and terms page. 



index.html:
 
    This is the log in page it has a form which contains the username and password input feilds for the user to log in if he/she has an account, otherwise there is a sign up button that takes the user to the sign up page to create an account.

    In the backend phase, validations will be added to the username and password feilds to make sure they come from a valid account



signup.html: 

    This page allows the user to create an account.
    It has a form that takes the information of the user (first name, last name, username, email, password) and locally validates all those feilds before allowing the user to proceed. It also doesn't allow the user to proceed until he/she presses the accept privacy and terms checkbox(the user can view privacy and terms from the link next to the checkbox).

    In the backend phase, the form needs to be further validated by the backend to make sure that the chosen username isn't already taken

    Note: page uses bootstrap for the form validation styles and to make it adjustable to different screen sizes.



Home.html:

    This is the home page of the website. It contains buttons that go to various pages.
        The explore more button takes the user to the articles page 
        The Learn more button takes the user to the about us page 
        The tests section has three buttons each of which takes the user to a specific test(depression,anxiety, or stress test)

    The page also contains testimonials section which displays the words of inspiring users of the website
    Lastly, like most other pages, this page contains the header section which contains the nav-bar and a footer section both sections described at the beginning of the README.mf file.



articles.html:

    This page contains different articles discussing different mental health issues. It shows the author of the article with a little description and a link to go to the article. 

    This page uses flexbox display to center and align the articles, and uses bootstrap for the nav-bar in the header 

    In the backend phase, the articles and their information(link, author info, author pic) will be loaded from the backend server



anxietyTest.html, depressionTest.html, stressTest.html:

    These html documents contain tests to check for anxiety, depression, or stress the user mught have. Each test is made out of 10 question, and each question has 4 choices for the user to choose from.
    After the test, the page display's the user's result and provides a button to go to a recommendations page to help the user fight the mental illness as much as possible.

    In the backend phase, the questions for the tests could be loaded from the backend server.

    This page contains to major sections:
        -Profile information section which contains most of the user's info (name,username, and email) and a form to change account password(in the change password form, the new password is validated through javascript to make sure it is at least 8 chars long and contains at least one upper case, lower case letter, number, and special character).
        -User progress tracker section which contains three graphs to show the users progress in the tests.
    
    The page uses the header > nav-bar and the foote discribed at the beginning of this document.

    In the backend phase, the user information, and the user progress(last 10 scores the user got in each test) will be obtained from the backend.
