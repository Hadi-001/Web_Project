# **Web_Project**

This is the project for the web course **CSC 443**  
**Team:** Adeeb Boumoghlbey, Hadi Shayya, Karam Alsaify  

This project is supposed to be made out of about **15 HTML pages**. The functionality of this website is assisting people to regulate and healthily deal with their **mental health**.

Almost all the content and material of the website (**not the code but the information**) is generated by **ChatGPT**.

---

## **Header > Nav-Bar:**

This component is found in almost every page (**not found in login, signup, or tests pages**) and in all of them, it looks and functions the same.

This component is from **Bootstrap**, but adjustments in the **HTML and CSS** were made to:
- Change the color to **light blue**
- Prevent elements from **overflowing** (at the screen size where elements overflow and the menu is not in mobile drop-down style yet, the margin of the links inside the nav-bar is changed from `15px` to `7px`)

---

## **Footer:**

This component is found in almost all pages (**not found in login, signup, or tests pages**) and contains basic information and links to the **FAQ page** and the **Privacy & Terms** page.

---

## **index.html:**

This is the **login page**. It has a form that contains the **username** and **password** input fields for the user to log in if they have an account. Otherwise, there is a **Sign Up** button that takes the user to the **sign-up page** to create an account.

In the **backend phase**, validations will be added to the **username** and **password** fields to ensure they come from a valid account.

---

## **signup.html:**

This page allows the user to **create an account**.
- It has a **form** that takes the user's information (**first name, last name, username, email, password**) and locally **validates** all fields before allowing the user to proceed.
- The user **must accept** the **Privacy & Terms** checkbox before proceeding (they can view Privacy & Terms from the link next to the checkbox).

In the **backend phase**, the form needs to be further validated to ensure that the **chosen username isn’t already taken**.

**Note:** Page uses **Bootstrap** for form validation styles and responsiveness.

---

---

## **articles.html:**

This page contains **different articles** discussing various **mental health issues**. It shows the **author of the article**, a **short description**, and a **link to read the full article**.

- Uses **Flexbox** for alignment and **Bootstrap** for the nav-bar in the header (described at the beginning of the document).
- In the **backend phase**, the articles and their information (**link, author info, author pic**) will be **loaded from the backend server**.

---

## **anxietyTest.html, depressionTest.html, stressTest.html:**

These pages contain **tests** to check for **anxiety, depression, or stress** the user might have.
- Each test has **10 questions**, and each question has **4 choices** for the user to select from.

*Phase 2 Documentation*

## Environment Setup  
- **XAMPP Installation**: Configured Apache & MySQL services locally.  
- **Project Directory**: Placed PHP, HTML, JS, CSS under `htdocs/Web_Project`.  
- **Database Configuration**: Created `web_project_db` in phpMyAdmin.  

## MySQL Database Schema  
- **ACCOUNT**: Stores user credentials and profiles.  
  - `id` (PK), `username` (UNIQUE), `password`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` (UNIQUE).  
- **ARTICLE**: Holds articles metadata.  
  - `id` (PK), `article_title`, `author_image`, `article_description`, `article_link`.  
- **FAQ**: Contains question–answer pairs.  
  - `id` (PK), `question`, `answer`.  
- **DISEASE**: Lists diseases for symptom pages.  
  - `id` (PK), `name`, `description`, `link`.  
- **TEST_SCORE**: Records user test results.  
  - `test_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK→ACCOUNT.id), `score`, `test_type`, `test_date`.  
- **FEEDBACK**: Captures user messages.  
  - `id` (PK), `username`, `email`, `message`.  

## Back-End Implementation (PHP)  
- **connection.php**: Central MySQL connection using `mysqli`; reads host, user, pass, db name; dies on connection error.  
- **index.php**: Renders login form; includes client-side placeholders; posts to `login_action.php`.  
- **login_action.php**: Accepts POST `{username, password}`, uses prepared statement `SELECT * FROM ACCOUNT WHERE username=?`, verifies with `password_verify()`, on success calls `session_start()`, sets `$_SESSION['user_id']`, returns JSON `{success:true}`, else `{success:false}`.  
- **signup.php**: Handles registration POST `{firstname, lastname, username, email, password}`, trims and sanitizes inputs, hashes password via `password_hash()`, inserts into `ACCOUNT` with prepared statement, redirects to login or echoes error.  
- **logout.php**: Calls `session_start()`, uses `unset($_SESSION['user_id'])` to log out the user, then sends `header("Location: index.php")` and exits.
- **check_email_username.php**: AJAX endpoint; receives POST `{username, email}`, queries `ACCOUNT` with `WHERE username=? OR email=?`, builds JSON flags `{username:bool, email:bool}` indicating availability.  
- **change_password.php**: AJAX endpoint; parses JSON body with `cur_pass` and `new_pass`, fetches stored hash, verifies current via `password_verify()`, hashes new password, updates `ACCOUNT` record, returns JSON `{success:true/false}`.  
- **save_data.php**: AJAX handler for tests; expects POST `{test_type, score}`, extracts first word of `test_type`, casts score to double, prepares `INSERT INTO TEST_SCORE (user_id, score, test_type, test_date)`, uses `date("Y-m-d H:i:s")`.  
- **get_scores.php**: Fetches last 7 records per test type (`stress`, `anxiety`, `depression`) for `$_SESSION['user_id']`, returns JSON `{success:true, data:{stress:{scores,dates},...}}`.  
- **submit_feedback.php**: Processes `contactUs.html` POST `{name, email, message}`, sanitizes and validates email, inserts into `FEEDBACK` via prepared statement, redirects back or echoes confirmation.  
- **profile.php**: Requires session, queries `ACCOUNT` for user fields, safely echoes name, username, email; renders change-password form wired to `change_password.php`.  

##  Front-End Improvement & Additional Features  
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Articles, FAQs, diseases, and profile details are generated via PHP loops and fetched from MySQL.  
- **Progress Tracker**: Three Chart.js line charts pull JSON from `get_scores.php` to visualize recent test performance.  
- **Form Validations**: Sign-up and password-change inputs are validated in-browser using JavaScript regex patterns and Bootstrap validation classes.  
- **AJAX-powered Login & Validation**: Login, sign-up availability checks, and password changes leverage fetch API for asynchronous interaction.  
- **Responsive & UX Tweaks**: Navbar link margins adjust at breakpoints; hover scale animations enhance feedback.  

## Integration of jQuery and AJAX  
- **jQuery Animations & DOM Enhancements**:  
  - **Nav-link Hover**: On `.nav-link:hover`, append a white `<span>` progress bar animated to full width over 300ms and scale link to 1.1×; on mouseout, reverse animation and remove span.  
  - **Navbar-brand Hover**: Scale logo `.navbar-brand` to 1.04×, change text color to white, set `font-weight:bold`, transition `0.3s`; revert on mouseout.  
  - **Test Button Hover**: Scale `.blue-button` and `.discard-button` to 1.1× on hover, reset on leave.  
  - **Response Container Hover**: Scale `.response-container` to 0.95× on `mouseenter`, reset on `mouseleave`.  
  - **Testimonial Card Hover**: Scale `.testimonial-card` to 1.05× on hover, revert on mouseout.  
- **AJAX (fetch API)**:  
  - **Sign-Up**: `check_email_username.php` for real-time username/email availability validation.  
  - **Login**: Posts to `login_action.php`, handles JSON `{success}` to redirect or show error.  
  - **Password Change**: Sends JSON to `change_password.php`, processes `{success}` response to alert user.  
  - **Test Scores**: Submits results to `save_data.php` immediately after test completion.  
  - **Chart Data**: GETs from `get_scores.php` to feed Chart.js datasets.
